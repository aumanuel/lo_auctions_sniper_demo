  <br>
  The newly added map will be displayed in the list, you can track the end time of the auction.<br>
  When the auction is over, the map remains in the list. The end time of the next auction is then calculated and displayed.<br>
  When the next auction occurs after the decay timer of the map, the map disappears from the list and is removed from the database.<br>
  <br>
  Consequently, once the map is correctly registered you will have the times of each end of auction until the disappearance of the map.<br>
